            <h3>What is this?</h3>
            <p>This is a Performance Task for my 21th Century Literature Subject during the 4th Quarter.
            This is under Ma'am K. Hi Ma'am K. Actually, Here on this website, I'll talk about my favorite pieces of literature 
            (very loose, dubious definition of literature I'm working with) and my experiences reading/watching/listening/playing them.

            <p>Here on this website, I'll talk about my favorite pieces of literature 
            (very loose, dubious definition of literature I'm working with) and my experiences 
            reading/watching/listening/playing them. These may not be the best of the best in the eyes of experts,
            but these are the best in <em>my opinion</em>.

            <h3>Are you allowed to do this?</h3>
            <p>At this point in time, I have yet to ask if this is even allowed. Easier to ask for forgiveness than to get permission.

            <p>Yup. This website should be reactive and work well on mobile.</p>
