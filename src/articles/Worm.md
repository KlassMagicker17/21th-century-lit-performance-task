summary: "One of the best (and only) webserial I have ever read."

This webserial posted its first chapter at July 2, 2011. I started reading it at 2020, well after the novel (I'm going to start calling it a novel so that I don't have to type such a long word like webserial) concluded. At that point John McCrae, or more popularly known online as Wildbow, has completed 3 other webserials and is--as I work on this--working and continually updating his most recent webserial, Pale.

It's actually clickbait-y to say that this is the only webserial I've ever read. I've read others. Though at this point, only Wildbow's. I've read Worm (obviously), I've also read the sequel to Worm, Ward. I'm also trying to read Pale, but with my brain on instant gratification mode, Youtube is the one feeding me my daily enjoyment.

Anyways, Worm is WILD. It is long, like **LONGGG**. It is the longest work I have ever read in my entire life. Second longest actually, since Ward is longer. Worm is a hundred thousand words shorter than the entire A Song of Ice and Fire Series (according to a cursory Google search.) George R.R. Martin first published the first installment of his series at 1996 and is still writing. Worm was written in **2** years. That's scares me at a level I can't even begin to describe.

Other than it's length, it's worldbuilding, plot, characters, all of it. Chef's Kiss. Powers in this universe are so enjoyable. They are gained from trauma, so standard so far. But where they differ from the normal superhero comics is that the powers are so unique. The main character, Taylor Hebert, has controls over simple organisms like bugs and crabs. People underestimate her power at first, but through her cleverness, she shows how *scary* organized bug attacks can be. Also why she was mistaken for a villain at the start of the story.

Other notable powers I remember the top of my head are: the power to be able to become unpercievable as threat, the power to be forgotten by everyone (insofar as even the people looking straight at you forget you're even there), and the power to make really good cameras. That last one might seem like a joke, but Tinkers are basically bestowed the power to have knowledge on how to build incredibly advanced technology.

The characters. Because of how powers are gained, 100% of capes (slang for people with powers) have some baggage or another. Throughout the story, Wildbow explores this trauma and weives them together beautifully. Taylor gained her powers because people bullied her, made her feel isolated. Her trigger point occured when she was shoved in a locker full of bugs. This is another things about powers here. The trauma relates--if only tangentially--to their power gained.

My words do no justice of how good of a read this webserial is and it's sequel. I've barely scratched the surface of what Worm truly is. Worm is all of this and more.

This is the greatest thing I might ever read in my lifetime. Well second to Ward. Well maybe until I read Terry Pratchett's Discworld. Maybe the best thing I'll read for free. Without pirating pdf's. Anyways, Worm is amazing: [read it here!](https://parahumans.wordpress.com/2011/06/11/1-1/)
