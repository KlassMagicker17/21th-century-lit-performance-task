Oh gosh, another medium. But hey, at least this one you *actually* read. Open Sorcery plays as BEL/S, a sentient firewall program. The game is played through an entire eventful week, encountering other antagonistic spirits and forming relationships with the people you protect.

I'm not going to lie, I didn't have money to buy this game when I learned about it. Instead, I pirated it like the greedy 15-year-old I was. But you can't put any blame on me, blame my younger self for having no impulse control. The main idea of the game is just too tempting to not play it. Like come on, programming *and* magic? What else can you want?

It is very self-evident why this game is attractive to me. I had fantasies of being able to program, so I ended up learning to do so early on for fun (program in asterisks, since I was playing around with HTML.) I felt so smart being able to open up the Window's default notepad, writing in some code I memorizied, and opening the file in a broswer, and seeing that it's all wrong, fixing it, then getting it to work. Programming in a nutshell.

Programming is close to my heart, and so is magic. I think it's a fair assessment that my liking for magic started when I watched anime. Pointing to one specific anime would be imposible--my memory is not very good this far back--but pointing to the Hero Channel is. The Hero Channel is Filipino Anime channel which I watched probably daily as a child. If I could have condensed that tv channel into a liquid, that stuff is going straight into my veins.

There. Magic and Programming, both very close to my heart. And that's why I love this game so much. It attracts me like a moth to a flame. It speaks to my childhood and inner child. I feel giddy playing this game. Open Sorcery is special

Magic in some animes (e.g. Full Metal Alchemist) is regarded as a science rather than magic. This is because for the characters in the universe, Alchemy is something that is studied and has rules it follows. But Abigail took that "magic is science" and spun it to "magic is *computer* science."

It is a strange blend that you wouldn't think would work, but it does. It does it so well. The idea of magic being understood in the context of IT has been done before (research: NULL), but Open Sorcery takes this idea and plays with it so well.
