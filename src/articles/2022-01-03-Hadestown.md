Hadestown is a modern retelling of the myth between the two lovers, Orpheus and Eurydice in a sort-of-but-not-really Depression Period. I've yet to watch a [slime tutorial](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=slime%20tutorial) of it, but I've listened to the entire album recording of it. Unlike most musicals, Hadestown is completely sung through, meaning there are no spoken lines (Well there are, but they're imbeded into songs so I don't think those count.), meaning-meaning that you can get half the experience of being the theatre just by opening Spotify. 

This musical might be my favorite out of all the musical I do listen to. But favorites are hard to quantify. A better metric would be by how many times I've listened to it. Now sadly, I'm not [waiting for days](https://thenextweb.com/news/a-simple-guide-to-visualising-your-spotify-listening-data-badass-ly) to get my Spotify listening habits, so instead I'll go with a more 'qualitative' approach.

> How many often do you think that you listen to this album?
>> a lot.

> Can you elaborate?
>> yes.

> Will you elaborate?
>> Um yeah sure.

> ...
>> Oh you want me to elaborate *now*? Well, I think I started listening to Hadestown only a bit recentely. Probably last summer. Or maybe the summer previous to that. Time flows weird in here house. Anyways, I probably listened to the entire 2-hour album at least thrice a week. I had other musicals that listened to, but Hadestown has got to be the one I listened to the most. Nowadays, I've been branching out, but I go back to Hadestown often.
