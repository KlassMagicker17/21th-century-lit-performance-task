This one is a bit more of a joke, but I'm going to include it anyways as a flex. Over the second summer of quarantite, I endeavored to translate the Iliad, 'cause why not? I sucked speaking and writing in Filipino, might as well try to get some practice in.

It's not as funny, polished, well-written, or finished as I'd like it to be. But it was fun when it lasted. I had python scripts that would translate LaTex files into html, which is an insane way to handle this kind of thing, but it was fun.

Now, the other reason why I placed this one is because I wanted to add here a Filipino piece. But I wracked my head, and nothing came out. I haven't read or watched or listened to Filipino stuff that could be worthy of being placed here. It sucks.

Yea the short stories we read in class were all great. Benjie X Mike â™¥, Trolls but not the stupid singing one's, Superman and her husband. All of these works were amazing reads. But it felt weird to have placed them here, seeing as everything else on here holds a sentimental value close to my heart.

Maybe if I'd found any of these on my own, then they'd be going on here, taking the spot of my joke of a *salin*. But no, I just don't consume enough Filipino media to have done so. I pity myself for oh-so out of touch with my own culture.

If you somehow wish to read my translation, then [folow this link](https://klassmagicker17.github.io/Iliada/). Be warned though, this include terrible Filipino (skill issue) and a lot of swearing to compensate my lack of comedic timing (other skill issue).
