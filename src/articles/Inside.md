There are bits of context to why I think this counts as literature. It moves people, it makes people feel. Bo Burnham may be a comedian on paper, but he is an artist at heart. He doesn't just tell jokes that makes you think, that's more George Carlin's style. No, he tells his jokes through songs that make you think, be introspective.

But the only true context is to see it for yourself. [Here's him performing one of his songs for MAKE HAPPY about his relationship with his audience.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYy0o-J0x20&ab_channel=boburnham) This is only a slice of what he does. If this is what a single song of his can do, what does an entire hour do?

I've followed Bo Burnham for some time now. Not as early as some, but early enough to remember myself humming to myself to the tune of "Kill Yourself". Funny stuff. But when he started having panic attacks on stage, he took a break. And a well deserved one at that. 

So fast forward a couple of years, the pandemic hit hard. I was looking for something to watch when I thought, "I want to rewatch a Bo Burnham special." And so I searched. And there it was, INSIDE. I was dumbstruck. What is that? Is this new? Did I miss something?

Of course the first course of action is to search the Internet for answers. Weirdly enough, Bo released this special a couple of days after I accidentally found it. Nice coincidence, right? And it was VERY fitting.

Inside is about the pandemic. But not just the pandemic. It was about Isolation. Being alone, apart from people.


The global plague was never mentioned once, only alluded to.
