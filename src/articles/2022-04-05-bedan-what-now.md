Ah yes, another one of those 'satire' pages.

The Bedan Meow is a new organization created by a bunch of HUMMS students with a sense of humor (or more accurately, none of it.)We are looking forward to not reporting anything of substance or anything that reflects reality. Instead we are going to be talking _all_ about that fake news.

We'll post about wacky scenarios that should have no business happening (but watch as the world slowly resembles the fake world), editorials with the stupidest opinions, hottest/coldest gossips around this part of SBU. We promise to post at least once a week. We also promise not to use clickbait. We also promise to send you hygiene products.

Again, if for some reason it hasn't cilcked yet, THIS. IS. NOT. REAL. None of it. Nada. Wala. Bilog. Everything that will be written here will be fiction. Maybe if we're feeling like it, we'll do actual satire, poke fun of SBU. Maybe. We promise to think about it.

And lastly, why are you doing here? What are we **all** doing here? Here on Earth? To just, exist? Wake up, eat, go to the bathroom, go work (or not), commute, die for 8 hours then resurrect once more to repeat the cycle? What's the point?

Anyways, we don't know. Bye and hopefully we you more next time.
